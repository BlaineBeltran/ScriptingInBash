# Project 02 - Scripting in Bash
In this project we will apply our coding skills to pick up some low-level scripting skills in our newly acquired Git-Bash terminal using the text editor **nano**

## Basic Vim commands used
```bash
 :help [keyword] - Performs a search of help documentation for whatever keyword you enter
 :w - Saves the file you are working on
 :w [filename] - Allows you to save your file with the name you've defined
 :wq - Save your file and close Vim
 :q! - Quit without first saving the file you were working on

```
## The process I took
I simply followed along during the tutorial that was given. I used the vim that comes installed in the mac terminal, so that helped. In addition, I cd into my repo when making all of the .sh files. Finally, I then used VS code to edit the README that your reading now and to push all of the files to GitHub üòÅ
