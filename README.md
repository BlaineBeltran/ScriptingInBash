# Project 02 - Scripting in Bash
In this project we will apply our coding skills to pick up some low-level scripting skills in our newly acquired Git-Bash terminal using the text editor **nano**

## Basic Vim commands used
```bash

- :help [keyword] - Performs a search of help documentation for whatever keyword you enter
- :w - Saves the file you are working on
- :w [filename] - Allows you to save your file with the name you've defined
- :wq - Save your file and close Vim
- :q! - Quit without first saving the file you were working on
```
